## Overview

The Jaya package provides an implementation of the Jaya algorithm, a gradient-free optimization method introduced by R.V. Rao (2016). This population-based algorithm can solve both single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems without requiring algorithm-specific control parameters. The algorithm works by moving toward the best solution and away from the worst solution, making it simple yet effective for a wide range of optimization problems.

## Key Features

- **Parameter-free optimization**: No algorithm-specific parameters to tune
- **Single-objective optimization**: Minimize or maximize a single objective function
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Find Pareto-optimal solutions balancing multiple objectives
- **Constraint handling**: Support for inequality constraints
- **Constraint visualization**: Visualize how constraints affect the Pareto front
- **Adaptive population adjustment**: Dynamically resize the population for improved convergence
- **Early stopping**: Terminate optimization when improvement stagnates
- **Parallel processing**: Speed up computation on multi-core systems

## Installation

You can install the released version of Jaya from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```r
install.packages("Jaya")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("neerajdhanraj/Jaya")
```

## Usage

### Single-Objective Optimization

```r
library(Jaya)

# Define a simple objective function (Sphere function)
sphere_function <- function(x) sum(x^2)

# Run the Jaya optimization algorithm
result <- jaya(
  fun = sphere_function,
  lower = rep(-5, 3),  # Lower bounds for 3 variables
  upper = rep(5, 3),   # Upper bounds for 3 variables
  popSize = 30,        # Population size
  maxiter = 100,       # Maximum iterations
  n_var = 3,           # Number of variables
  opt = "minimize"     # Minimize the function
)

# Display the results
summary(result)

# Plot the convergence
plot(result)
```

### Multi-Objective Optimization

```r
# Define multiple objectives
objective1 <- function(x) sum(x^2)
objective2 <- function(x) sum((x - 2)^2)

# Define constraints (must return <= 0 for feasibility)
constraint1 <- function(x) sum(x) - 3  # Sum of variables must be <= 3
constraint2 <- function(x) -sum(x) + 1 # Sum of variables must be >= 1

# Run the enhanced multi-objective optimization with constraint tracking
result_multi <- jaya_multi_enhanced(
  objectives = list(objective1, objective2),
  lower = c(-5, -5),
  upper = c(5, 5),
  popSize = 50,
  maxiter = 100,
  n_var = 2,
  constraints = list(constraint1, constraint2)
)

# Visualize constraints and Pareto front
plot_jaya_constraints(result_multi)

# Plot pairwise objectives
plot_jaya_multi_pairwise(result_multi)
```

## Additional Features

### Early Stopping

For problems that converge quickly:

```r
result <- jaya(
  fun = sphere_function,
  lower = rep(-5, 3),
  upper = rep(5, 3),
  popSize = 30,
  maxiter = 100,
  n_var = 3,
  early_stopping = TRUE,  # Enable early stopping
  tolerance = 1e-6,       # Convergence tolerance
  patience = 10           # Number of iterations without improvement
)
```

### Adaptive Population Sizing

Dynamically adjust the population size:

```r
result <- jaya(
  fun = sphere_function,
  lower = rep(-5, 3),
  upper = rep(5, 3),
  popSize = 50,
  maxiter = 100,
  n_var = 3,
  adaptive_pop = TRUE,  # Enable adaptive population
  min_popSize = 20,     # Minimum population size
  max_popSize = 100     # Maximum population size
)
```

## Constraint Visualization

Understand how constraints affect the Pareto front in multi-objective optimization:

```r
# Visualize all constraints
plot_jaya_constraints(result_multi)

# Focus on a specific constraint
plot_jaya_constraints(result_multi, constraints_to_show = 1)

# Create an interactive visualization
plot_jaya_constraints(result_multi, interactive = TRUE)
```
