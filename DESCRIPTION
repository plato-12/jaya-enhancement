Description: An implementation of the Jaya optimization algorithm for both 
    single-objective and multi-objective problems. Jaya is a population-based, 
    gradient-free optimization algorithm capable of solving constrained and 
    unconstrained optimization problems without hyperparameters. This package 
    includes features such as multi-objective Pareto optimization, adaptive 
    population adjustment, constraint handling and visualization, and early stopping.
